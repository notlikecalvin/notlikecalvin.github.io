Part of Neal Stephenson's final book in the Baroque Cycle involves a heist from the Tower of London. It's quite complicated, with a number of different characters running around various buildings in the Tower complex and it can be tricky to keep track of what's going on.

One grey day I took a trip to the Tower to see how closely the book married up to real life.

On a different occasion I went to the <a href="2020-01-02-Fire_Monument.md">Fire Monument</a>, where the heist actually starts.
