A lockdown project that got a bit out of hand. So far I've designed Lego models of <a href="https://www.etcconnect.com/" title="Electronic Theatre Controls">ETC</a>'s **Ion classic** and **Gio** consoles, and **Sensor 3** dimmer modules and rack.

I've shamelessly based the *Lego Theatre* theming on the *<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/architecture/story" title="Lego Architecture at Lego.com">Lego Architecture</a>* range.

## ION

ETC's original <a href="https://www.etcconnect.com/Products/Legacy/Console/Eos-Family/Ion/Features.aspx" title="ION classic console at ETCconnect.com">ION console</a>, with its small footprint and large featureset, powers a range of performance around the world. As the console I'm most physically familiar with it was an obvious place to start.

This model is approximately quarter-scale, sized mainly around the layout of the button banks: 240 pieces, 11cm wide by 15cm deep. The main challenge with these consoles is the angled faceplate and how that attaches to the base section - this one uses a hinge connection at the front.

If you want to make one yourself, you can access the parts list on BrickLink, download the instructions, and assemble your own erzatz retail packaging. I've done a fancy brochure with light text on dark pages, but there's also a more ink-friendly inverted version of the instructions.

## Sensor3 modules and Rack24

As a bit of a break from the ION, I started modelling a ThruPower module at the same scale, trying to get as much detail as possible into a relatively compact space only three tiles high:

With a bunch of those stacked up I could make a whole rack, so better to design a CEM module as well to control them:

I made the modules with a groove in each side one tile thick, so they could slot into a supporting structure in the cabinet.

Although a 36 or 48 channel cabinet might be more common in dimmer rooms, a shorter 24 channel / 12 module rack uses much fewer pieces, and it was more straightforward to have one large tile for the majority of the door. That door was tricky to make close flush, with more sticky-out hinges than the real thing, and I couldn't make a lock mechanism without cluttering up the design too much.
