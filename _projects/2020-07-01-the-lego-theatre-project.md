A lockdown project that got a bit out of hand. So far I've designed Lego models of ETC's <em>Ion classic</em> and <em>Gio</em> consoles, and <em>Sensor 3</em> dimmer modules and rack.

<h2>ION</h2>

ETC's original ION, with its small footprint and large featureset, powers a range of performance around the world. As the console I'm most familiar with it was an obvious place to start.

This model is approximately quarter-scale, sized mainly around the layout of the button banks. The main challenge with these consoles is the angled faceplate and how that attaches to the base section.

You can access the parts list on BrickLink, and download the instructions and boxart below. I've done a fancy brochure with light text on dark pages, but there's also a more printer-friendly inverted version of the instructions.
