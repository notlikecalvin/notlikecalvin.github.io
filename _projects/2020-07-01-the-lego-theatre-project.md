A lockdown project that got a bit out of hand. So far I've designed Lego models of <a href="https://www.etcconnect.com/" title="Electronic Theatre Controls">ETC</a>'s **Ion classic** and **Gio** consoles, and **Sensor 3** dimmer modules and rack.

## ION

ETC's original <a href="https://www.etcconnect.com/Products/Legacy/Console/Eos-Family/Ion/Features.aspx" title="ION classic console at ETCconnect.com">ION console</a>, with its small footprint and large featureset, powers a range of performance around the world. As the console I'm most familiar with it was an obvious place to start.

This model is approximately quarter-scale, sized mainly around the layout of the button banks: 240 pieces, 11x15cm. The main challenge with these consoles is the angled faceplate and how that attaches to the base section - this one uses a hinge connection at the front of the faceplate.

Access the parts list on BrickLink, download the instructions, and assemble your own retail packaging. I've done a fancy brochure with light text on dark pages, but there's also a more ink-friendly inverted version of the instructions.

## Sensor3 Rack24

As a bit of a break from the ION, I started modelling a ThruPower module at the same scale, trying to get as much detail as possible into a relatively compact space only three tiles high.
