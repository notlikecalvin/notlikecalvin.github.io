I made a far too large infographic with far too much detail based on every episode of <em>Doctor Who</em>. As a 'relativity matrix' it shows Doctors, companions, appearances by notable adversaries and the time frame that events take place in - all by the factor of episodic screen time. The chart lists serial/episode titles, production seasons/years, accumulating running time, character fates and breakdowns of gender/species.

If printed at full design resolution the matrix would need to be over five metres wide, but it can probably be squished down a fair bit and still be mostly legible; it was an exercise in over-specificity rather than practical application.

As I finished this version of the matrix in early 2010, it runs up to and including the first brief appearance of the Eleventh Doctor. An update is on the distant back-burner.
